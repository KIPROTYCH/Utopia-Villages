## Description

This project, "Utopia Villages App," enhances real estate functionality with user authentication, advanced search, interactive map, and virtual tours. It includes a mortgage calculator, responsive design, property comparison, neighborhood info, real-time updates, and user reviews. These features create a comprehensive and appealing real estate web app, ensuring a seamless user experience for potential buyers.

### Key Features:

#### Components and Props:
The app utilizes React components to create modular and reusable UI elements. Components like BotCollection and YourBotArmy are employed to display the available bots and the user's enlisted bots, respectively. Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components, enabling seamless data transfer and rendering.

#### State and Events:
React's state management is employed to handle dynamic data within the application. The useState hook is utilized to manage the list of bots and the enlisted bots. Events like enlisting and releasing bots trigger state updates, ensuring a responsive user interface.

#### Data Fetching:
The app utilizes the Axios library to fetch data from an API endpoint. Upon loading, the app retrieves a list of bots from the server and stores it in the application's state for rendering on the UI.

#### Grid Layout:
To enhance the UI's visual appeal and organization, the bots are displayed in a grid layout. This layout dynamically adjusts based on available space, ensuring a clean and aesthetically pleasing presentation.
